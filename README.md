# Skin-Disease-Prediction-Using-ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch
### [Decision Tree & K-Nearest Neighbours classification models have been applied on this dataset. Both the algorithms are implemented from scratch without using Scikit learn library]
## Aim: To determine the type of Erythemato-Squamous Disease
The differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases is a real problem in 
dermatology. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with very 
little differences. The diseases in this group are: -
1. psoriasis
2. seboreic dermatitis 
3. lichen planus 
4. pityriasis rosea 
5. cronic dermatitis 
6. pityriasis rubra pilaris
